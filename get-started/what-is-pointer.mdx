Pointer is a platform for running AI agents. If you’re building agents that need to use multiple tools, control browsers, and perform complex automations, Pointer manages the underlying infrastructure so you don’t have to.

We bundle all the critical dependencies for running production-grade agents into a complete, out-of-the-box solution. This means **no frameworks are required**. Pointer provides a simple API for deploying stateful, persistent agents, features for managing custom tools, and a scalable, reliable infrastructure to run them in production.
