> Agentbase uses step-based pricing designed for multi-step agentic workflows, charging per action rather than per token.

## Agent Modes

Choose from three optimized modes:

| Mode | Cost Range | Best For |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Fast** | ~$0.02 per step | Simple tasks, high-volume operations |
| **Flash** | $0.05 - $0.12 per step | General-purpose workflows (recommended default) |
| **Max** | $0.12 - $0.20 per step | Complex reasoning, multi-step analysis |

## Key Features

### Automatic Cost Tracking
```javascript
// Included in every API response
{
  "type": "agent_cost",
  "session": "e3jbak7k4xnvct3",
  "cost": "0.0146",
  "balance": 47.4557,
  "deductionSuccess": true,
  "lowBalance": false
}
```

### How Costs Scale

| Task Type | Computer Needed? | Cost Level | Examples |
|-----------|------------------|------------|----------|
| **Text & Analysis** | No | Lower | Writing, research, planning |
| **Code & Files** | Yes | Medium | Programming, file operations |
| **Multi-tool Workflows** | Yes | Higher | Web scraping + analysis + reports |

<Note>
  Costs increase when agents use computer environments and multiple tools. Simple text-based tasks keep costs minimal.
