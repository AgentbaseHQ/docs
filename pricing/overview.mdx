> Pay per action, not per token. Simple pricing that scales with value delivered.

## Why Step-Based Pricing?

Instead of confusing token-based billing, Agentbase charges per **step** - each discrete action your agent takes.

**What counts as a step:**
- Planning and reasoning
- Tool usage (web search, file operations, etc.)
- Analysis and decision making
- Response generation

**Total Cost of Ownership Benefits:**
- **Fewer total steps** - Our optimized agents complete tasks more efficiently
- **Predictable costs** - No surprise bills from token overruns  
- **Value-aligned pricing** - Pay for results, not just compute time
- **No token counting** - Focus on building, not optimization

## Pricing Table

| Mode | Context Size | Cost per Step | Cached Step | Best For |
|------|-------------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **Fast** | < 30k tokens | **$0.01** | **$0.003** | Simple tasks, high-volume operations |
| | 30k - 128k tokens | **$0.04** | **$0.012** | Larger simple tasks |
| **Flash** | < 30k tokens | **$0.05** | **$0.015** | Balanced workflows (recommended) |
| | 30k - 128k tokens | **$0.15** | **$0.045** | Complex tasks with larger context |
| **Max** | < 30k tokens | **$0.15** | **$0.045** | Advanced reasoning and analysis |
| | 30k - 128k tokens | **$0.40** | **$0.12** | Complex large-context tasks |

### Get Started
- **Free credits** with work email signup
- **Start small**: Fast mode for experimentation and simple tasks
- **Scale up**: Flash mode for most production workflows
- **Production budget**: $15-$30 recommended for extensive testing

## Context Window Tiers

Our pricing reflects the computational cost of processing different context sizes:

### Small Context (< 30k tokens)
- **Most cost-effective** for standard workflows
- Handles typical conversations, documents, and code files
- Best for: API calls, data analysis, simple automation

### Large Context (30k - 128k tokens)
- **Higher pricing** reflects increased computational requirements
- Supports large documents, extensive conversations, complex codebases
- Best for: Document analysis, long conversations, comprehensive research

## Prompt Caching

**Cached rates** apply when context is reused across steps - **70% savings** on repeated context processing. Perfect for conversational agents and recurring workflows.

## How We Optimize Your Costs

### Intelligent Model Routing
Agentbase uses a **mixture of models** optimized for different task types, automatically routing to the most cost-effective option:

**Step Reduction Strategy:**
- **Smart planning** reduces redundant operations
- **Efficient context management** across multi-step workflows
- **Optimized tool usage** minimizes unnecessary steps

**Value Alignment:**
- We make money when we solve your problems efficiently
- Our incentive is to reduce total steps, which saves you money
- Focus on **Total Cost of Ownership**, not per-API-call pricing

## Cost Tracking & Features

### Real-Time Cost Monitoring
```javascript
// Included in every API response
{
  "type": "agent_cost",
  "session": "e3jbak7k4xnvct3",
  "cost": "0.0146",
  "balance": 47.4557,
  "deductionSuccess": true,
  "lowBalance": false
}
```

### How Costs Scale by Task Type

| Task Type | Computer Needed? | Cost Level | Examples |
|-----------|------------------|------------|----------|
| **Text & Analysis** | No | Lower | Writing, research, planning |
| **Code & Files** | Yes | Medium | Programming, file operations |
| **Multi-tool Workflows** | Yes | Higher | Web scraping + analysis + reports |

<Note>
  Costs increase when agents use computer environments and multiple tools. Simple text-based tasks keep costs minimal.
