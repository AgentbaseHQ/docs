# What You Can Do With Agentbase

Agentbase's powerful yet simple API makes it easy for developers to integrate AI agents into virtually any application or workflow. Here are some of the most impactful ways you can leverage our platform:

## Application Integration

### Adding Agents to Your Application
Transform your existing application by integrating intelligent agents that can handle complex user interactions, automate processes, and provide intelligent assistance. With our [streamlined API](/api/quickstart), you can have agents running in your app in minutes.

### Transforming Your SaaS Platform to be Agent-Native
Convert your traditional SaaS platform into an intelligent, agent-powered experience. Your users can interact naturally with your platform's features through conversational interfaces, making complex workflows feel effortless.
