Welcome to Agentbase!

This quickstart guide will have you running AI-powered agents in just a few minutes. By the end, you'll understand how to use Agentbase for intelligent automation and complex task execution.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:
- A terminal or command prompt open
- Node.js 18 or newer installed (for JavaScript examples)
- Python 3.7+ installed (for Python examples)  
- An HTTP client (curl comes pre-installed on most systems)
- A code project or workspace to experiment with

## Step 1: Create your account

Agentbase requires an account to use. When you start using the API, you'll need your credentials:

- Navigate to [base.agentbase.sh/sign-up](https://base.agentbase.sh/sign-up) and create your account
- Go to the [Overview page](https://base.agentbase.sh/overview) to generate your API key  
- Visit the [Billing page](https://base.agentbase.sh/credits) to purchase credits

**Credit recommendations for development:**
- **$5**: Enough for basic development, testing, and experimentation
- **$20-30**: For extensive testing over days or weeks of continuous development
- **Note**: Costs increase with more API features utilized and larger context sizes

**Pro tip**: Sign up with your work email to automatically receive credits!

## Step 2: Make your first API call

Let's start by asking the agent to introduce itself:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"message": "What can you do?"}'
```

You'll receive a real-time stream of the agent's response showing its capabilities and thought process.

## Step 3: Try different tasks

Now let's explore what your agent can do. Try these examples:

### Code Generation
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"message": "Write a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers"}'
```

### Data Analysis
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"message": "Create a JSON schema for a user profile with name, email, and preferences"}'
```

### Web Search and Research
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"message": "Search for the latest developments in AI and summarize the key findings"}'
```

### Complex Automation
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"message": "Plan a project roadmap for building a mobile app with user authentication, including technical requirements and timeline"}'
```

## Step 4: Understand streaming and modes

Agentbase provides different response modes and streaming options:

### Streaming Behavior
```bash
# Non-streaming (default) - returns complete blocks of text and actions
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Write a product description",
    "streaming": false
  }'

# Streaming enabled - returns token-by-token responses  
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Analyze this website and suggest improvements", 
    "streaming": true
  }'
```

### Agent Modes
```bash
# Flash mode - see agent thinking process (upgraded from fast)
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Plan a marketing strategy",
    "mode": "flash"
  }'

# Fast mode - balanced performance (default)
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Generate code examples",
    "mode": "fast"
  }'

# Max mode - complex reasoning and planning
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Design a complete system architecture",
    "mode": "max"
  }'
```

**Key insights:**
- **Streaming `false`**: Returns complete blocks of text and finished actions
- **Streaming `true`**: Shows token-by-token output as it's generated  
- **Flash mode**: Reveals agent thinking process (upgrade from fast mode)
- **Cost**: Increases with more features used and larger context sizes
- **Models**: Agentbase uses a mixture of models optimized for different tasks

## Step 5: Continue conversations with sessions

Sessions allow you to maintain context across multiple interactions. **You must reuse the session ID to continue the chat conversation.**

```bash
# First message - creates a new session
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"message": "Help me plan a marketing campaign for a SaaS product"}'

# Save the session ID from the response, then continue the conversation
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh?session=SESSION_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"message": "Now create social media content for this campaign"}'
```

**Session Management:**
- **Auto-Creation**: If you don't specify a session ID, a new one is automatically created
- **Continue Conversations**: Append `?session=[SESSION_ID]` to the URL for follow-up messages
- **Persistent Context**: The agent remembers previous messages within the same session

## Step 6: Integrate with your application

Use Agentbase in your preferred programming language:

### JavaScript/Node.js
```javascript
const response = await fetch('https://api.agentbase.sh', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    message: 'Generate a product description for an AI-powered analytics tool',
    mode: 'fast'
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data);
```

### Python
```python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.agentbase.sh',
    headers={
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    json={
        'message': 'Create a data analysis report from this CSV data',
        'mode': 'fast'
    }
)

data = response.json()
print(data)
```

### cURL with Custom Tools and Rules
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Optimize this SQL query for better performance",
    "mode": "max",
    "system": "You are a database optimization expert",
    "rules": ["Always explain your reasoning", "Provide before/after comparisons"],
    "mcpServers": [
      {
        "serverName": "database-tools", 
        "serverUrl": "https://your-mcp-server.com/mcp"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

**Important notes:**
- **Custom Tools**: Each tool needs a definition via MCP servers
- **Rules**: Provide constraints that the agent must follow
- **System Prompts**: Give the agent specific expertise or context

## Step 7: Explore advanced capabilities

Your Agentbase agents come with powerful built-in tools:

### File Processing
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Analyze this spreadsheet and create visualizations of the key trends"}'
```

### Web Automation
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Monitor competitor pricing on their website and compile a comparison report"}'
```

### Multi-step Planning
```bash

  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Create a complete deployment strategy for a new microservice, including CI/CD pipeline, monitoring, and rollback procedures"}'
```

## Step 8: Debug common issues

Understanding how to troubleshoot your Agentbase integration:

### Streaming Issues
```bash
# If your stream is choked and token-by-token, you may have enabled streaming
# Use streaming: false for complete blocks of text
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Write documentation",
    "streaming": false
  }'
```

### See Agent Thinking
```bash
# To see the agent's reasoning process, upgrade from fast to flash mode
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Solve this complex problem step by step",
    "mode": "flash"
  }'
```

### Set up proper error handling
```javascript
try {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.agentbase.sh', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message: 'Your task here',
      mode: 'fast'
    })
  });
  
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
  }
  
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Agent request failed:', error);
}
```
