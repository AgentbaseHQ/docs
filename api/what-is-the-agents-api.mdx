The Agents API is a simple, production-grade interface for interacting with persistent, intelligent AI agents running on Agentbase's managed infrastructure.

It allows you to:
- **Send complex tasks** to a pre-built, capable agent.
- **Receive streaming, real-time responses** and observe the agent's thought process.
- **Leverage built-in tools** like web search, code execution, and file management automatically.
- **Manage stateful, long-running agent sessions** for persistent automation.
- **Integrate powerful reasoning and automation** into your own products and workflows.

Agentbase's Agents API is designed to be:
- **Framework-Free**: You don't need an agent framework; just call the API.
- **Scalable**: Run a single agent or thousands, with our infrastructure handling the load.
