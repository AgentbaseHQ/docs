> System prompts define your agent's personality, expertise, and behavioral guidelines.

System prompts are often used to define:
- **Role** - What the agent is and its expertise
- **Behavior** - How the agent should act and respond
- **Tool definitions** - Specific tools and capabilities to use
- **Process workflow** - Steps and procedures to follow

## Customer Support Agent

```javascript
// Reusable pattern for different support tiers
const createSupportAgent = (productName, tier) => {
  return agentbase.runAgent({
    message: userQuestion,
    system: `You are a ${tier} support agent for ${productName}.
    
Role: Resolve customer issues and provide product guidance
Behavior: Professional, empathetic, solution-focused
Tools: Access knowledge base, create tickets, escalate when needed
Process: 
1. Understand the issue completely
2. Check knowledge base for solutions
3. Provide step-by-step guidance
4. ${tier === 'L1' ? 'Escalate complex technical issues' : 'Handle technical deep-dives'}`,
    
    rules: [
      "Never share internal system details",
      "Always verify user identity for account changes",
      "Keep responses under 200 words unless technical explanation needed"
    ]
  });
};
```

## Website Change Detection Agent

```javascript
// Monitor competitor websites for changes
const detectWebsiteChanges = async (websiteUrl, companyName) => {
  const sessionId = `monitor_${companyName.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '_')}`;
  
  return await agentbase.runAgent({
    message: `Monitor ${websiteUrl} for changes since last check and generate change report`,
    system: `You are a website change detection specialist monitoring ${companyName}'s online presence.

Behavior: Methodical, detail-oriented, comprehensive in change detection

      "Store all snapshots in memory with timestamp metadata",

      "Respect robots.txt and rate limiting while crawling"
    ]
  });
};
