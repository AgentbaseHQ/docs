## Available Modes

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Fast Mode" color="#10b981">
    Most cost optimized and efficient
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flash Mode" color="#f59e0b">
    Thinking capability with good speed
  </Card>
  <Card title="Max Mode" color="#8b5cf6">
    Highest capability for complex tasks
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why Model Mixtures?

Agentbase offers three distinct agent modes that optimize performance and cost through intelligent model selection. Rather than using a single model, each mode employs a **mixture of models** including custom models specifically designed to reduce agent execution steps and overall costs.

<Note>
Mode selection is automatically optimized based on task complexity, but you can override the default behavior by specifying your preferred mode.
