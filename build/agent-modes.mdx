Agentbase offers three distinct agent modes that optimize performance and cost through intelligent model selection. Rather than using a single model, each mode employs a **mixture of models** including custom models specifically designed to reduce agent execution steps and overall costs.

## Why Model Mixtures?

Agent costs are primarily driven by input tokens (approximately 80% of total cost), as agents must send the same context repeatedly across multiple steps. By using intelligent model mixtures, we can:

- **Reduce execution steps** through smarter planning
- **Lower input token costs** by completing tasks more efficiently  
- **Optimize for specific use cases** with specialized model combinations
