## Available Modes

| Mode | Cost per Step | Best For |
|:-----|:--------------|:---------|
| Flash | $0.01 | Simple tasks, quick responses |
| Fast | $0.05 | Most tasks, balanced performance |
| Max | $0.20 | Complex reasoning, multi-step workflows |

Agentbase offers three distinct agent modes that optimize performance and cost through intelligent model selection. Rather than using a single model, each mode employs a **mixture of models** including custom models specifically designed to reduce agent execution steps and overall costs.

<Note>
Mode selection is automatically optimized based on task complexity, but you can override the default behavior by specifying your preferred mode.
