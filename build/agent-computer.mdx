> Explore the full Linux environment that agents can access for code execution, file operations, web browsing, and complex workflows.

When agents need to perform tasks requiring persistent state or system access, Agentbase automatically creates a full Linux computer environment with comprehensive tools and capabilities.

## When Computer Environments Are Created

Computer environments are created automatically when agents need to perform tasks that require:

  <Card title="Code & Development" icon="code">
    Python, Node.js, or other language execution, package installation, testing, and debugging
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="File Operations" icon="file">
    Creating, reading, writing, or processing files, data transformation, and file system management
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Web Interaction" icon="globe">
    Web scraping, browser automation, form submission, and website testing
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="System Operations" icon="terminal">
    Shell commands, system configuration, process management, and tool installation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  **Automatic Creation**: You don't need to explicitly request a computer - agents create them automatically when tasks require persistent state or system access.
