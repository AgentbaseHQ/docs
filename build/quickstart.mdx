Get your first AI agent running locally in 2 minutes.

## Before you begin

* [Agentbase account](https://base.agentbase.sh/sign-up) with credits
* Node.js 18+ installed

<Tip>Sign up with your work email to get free credits automatically!</Tip>

## Step 1: Install and run

```bash
# Create your agent project
npm create agentbase@latest

# Navigate and start
cd my-agent
npm run dev
```

You'll be prompted to add your API key on first use.

## Step 2: Test capabilities

Try these prompts in the CLI to understand what agents can do:

```
> What can you do?
> Write and run a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers
> Search for the latest AI news and summarize it
> Create a React component for a user profile card
```

## Step 3: Understand agent modes

Change the mode in your `index.ts` file:

```typescript
const params = { 
  message: message,
  mode: "fast" // "fast", "flash", or "max"
};
```

**Mode differences:**

- **Fast**: Balanced performance (recommended)
- **Flash**: Shows agent thinking process and steps
- **Max**: Advanced reasoning for complex tasks

## Ready to integrate?

The CLI uses the same API your applications will use. Everything you tested here works in production.

### Key integration parameters:

| Parameter | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `message` | The task | `"Write a Python function"` |
| `mode` | Capability level | `"fast"`, `"flash"`, `"max"` |
| `session` | Continue conversation | `?session=SESSION_ID` |
