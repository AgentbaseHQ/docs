> Agents automatically select and use tools based on your task. No configuration required.

## How Tools Work

Agents automatically choose tools when needed:

```javascript
// Agent will automatically use web browsing tools
const research = await agentbase.runAgent({
  message: "Find the latest pricing for our competitors"
});

// Agent will automatically create computer environment and use bash/file tools
const development = await agentbase.runAgent({
  message: "Create a Python script that processes CSV data"
});
```

## Available Tools

Based on comprehensive API testing, here are the verified tools that Agentbase agents have access to:

| Category | Tool | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **File System** | `str_replace_editor` | Create, edit, view, and manage files with persistent state across sessions |
| | `bash` | Run shell commands with internet access and package management capabilities |
| | `glob` | Find files using glob patterns (e.g., `*.js`, `**/*.ts`) |
| | `grep` | Search for text patterns in files with regex support |
| **Web Tools** | `web` (search) | Search the web for real-time information and current data |
| | `web` (crawl) | Extract content from specific URLs and websites |
| **Computer Environment** | `computer` | Create/resume Linux computer instances for development tasks |
| **Thinking & Planning** | `think` | Private scratchpad for complex reasoning, planning, and maintaining context |
| **Development Environment** | Python 3.11.2 | Execute Python code and scripts |
| | Node.js 18.20.4 | JavaScript runtime environment |
| | Package management | apt (Debian), pip (Python), npm (Node.js) |

## Example Tool Event Flow

When agents use tools, the API streams real-time events showing tool execution:

```json
// Tool execution starts
{"type": "agent_tool_use", "content": "{\"tool\":\"web\",\"input\":\"{\\\"command\\\":\\\"search\\\",\\\"query\\\":\\\"AI developments 2025\\\"}\"}"}

// Tool returns results  
{"type": "agent_tool_response", "content": "{\n  \"tool\": \"web\",\n  \"response\": [\n    {\n      \"url\": \"https://example.com/ai-news\",\n      \"title\": \"Latest AI Developments\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"}

// Cost tracking
{"type": "agent_cost", "session": "abc123", "cost": "0.0095", "balance": 47.45}

// Step completion
{"type": "agent_step", "session": "abc123", "stepNumber": 1}
```

## Custom Tools

You can write custom code tools with environment variables in the Agentbase app's Tools section:
