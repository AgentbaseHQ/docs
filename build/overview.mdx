## What You Can Build

Agentbase agents can handle a wide variety of tasks with built-in capabilities:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Code & Development" icon="code">
    **Built-in capabilities:**
    - Write, test, and debug code in Python, Node.js, and more
    - Install packages and manage dependencies
    - Run tests and validate outputs
    - Work with files and Git repositories

    **Example tasks:**
    - "Create a REST API with authentication"
    - "Write unit tests for my Python module"
    - "Debug this error and fix the code"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Research & Analysis" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Built-in capabilities:**
    - Search the web for real-time information
    - Crawl and scrape websites
    - Process and analyze data
    - Synthesize insights from multiple sources

    **Example tasks:**
    - "Research our top 3 competitors and their pricing"
    - "Analyze this dataset and create visualizations"
    - "Find the latest AI research papers on this topic"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Browser Automation" icon="browser">
    **Built-in capabilities:**
    - Navigate websites and fill forms
    - Extract data from web pages
    - Test web applications
    - Automate repetitive browser tasks

    **Example tasks:**
    - "Fill out this form submission"
    - "Test the checkout flow on our website"
    - "Monitor competitor pricing daily"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Data Processing" icon="database">
    **Built-in capabilities:**
    - Read and write various file formats
    - Transform and clean data
    - Generate reports and summaries
    - Work with APIs and integrations

    **Example tasks:**
    - "Convert these CSV files to JSON"
    - "Process customer feedback and categorize by sentiment"
    - "Generate a weekly report from our analytics"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Agent">
    ```bash
    npm create agentbase@latest
    cd my-agent
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Capabilities">
    Try a prompt to see what agents can do:
    ```
    > Create a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize Your Agent">
    Add custom tools, system prompts, and rules to match your needs
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Architecture

Agentbase handles all the complex infrastructure so you don't have to:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Your Application] --> B[Agentbase API]
    B --> C[Agent Runtime]
    C --> D[Sandboxed Environment]
    C --> E[Tool Execution]
    C --> F[State Management]
    D --> G[File System]
    D --> H[Browser]
    D --> I[Shell Access]
    E --> J[Built-in Tools]
    E --> K[Custom Tools]
    F --> L[Session Persistence]
    F --> M[Context Management]
```

**What Agentbase manages for you:**
- Agent orchestration and reasoning
- Sandboxed execution environments
- Tool selection and execution
- State and session persistence
- Scaling and load balancing
- Security and compliance

## Agent Primitives

Build sophisticated agents using Agentbase primitives - the building blocks that power agent functionality:
