## Build AI Agents Without Infrastructure

Agentbase is a serverless platform for building production-grade AI agents. Focus on what your agent does, not on managing infrastructure, frameworks, or dependencies.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Your Agent">
    ```bash
    npm create agentbase@latest
    cd my-agent
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Capabilities">
    Try a prompt to see what agents can do:
    ```
    > Create a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize Your Agent">
    Add custom tools, system prompts, and rules to match your needs
  </Step>
</Steps>
