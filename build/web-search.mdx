> Agents automatically use web search and crawling tools to find information and extract content from websites.

## How It Works

Agents use the `web` tool with two commands: `search` to find relevant URLs and `crawl` to extract content from specific pages.

```javascript
// Basic usage - agent chooses the right web tool automatically
const response = await agentbase.runAgent({
  message: "Find the latest AI news and summarize the key developments"
});
```

## Web Tool Commands

### Search
Finds relevant URLs and metadata from search engines:

```json
// Tool call
{"tool": "web", "input": {"command": "search", "query": "AI developments 2025"}}

// Returns
{
  "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/25/openai-says-gpt-5-stacks-up-to-humans/",
  "title": "OpenAI says GPT-5 stacks up to humans in a wide range of jobs", 
  "publishedDate": "2025-09-25T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Crawl
Extracts full content from specific URLs:

```json
// Tool call
{"tool": "web", "input": {"command": "crawl", "urls": ["https://example.com/article"]}}

// Returns
{
  "url": "https://example.com/article",
  "content": "Full article text and content extracted from the webpage..."
}
```

## Common Patterns

```javascript
// Research workflow
"Search for competitor pricing and analyze their strategies"

// Content extraction
"Crawl these 3 product pages and compare their features"

// News monitoring  
"Find recent news about quantum computing and summarize key breakthroughs"
```
