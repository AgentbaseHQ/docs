Agentbase offers three distinct agent modes that optimize performance and cost through intelligent model selection. Rather than using a single model, each mode employs a **mixture of models** including custom models specifically designed to reduce agent execution steps and overall costs.

## Why Model Mixtures?

Agent costs are primarily driven by input tokens (approximately 80% of total cost), as agents must send the same context repeatedly across multiple steps. By using intelligent model mixtures, we can:

- **Reduce execution steps** through smarter planning
- **Lower input token costs** by completing tasks more efficiently  
- **Optimize for specific use cases** with specialized model combinations

## Available Modes

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Fast Mode" color="#10b981">
    Most cost optimized and efficient
  </Card>
  <Card title="Flash Mode" color="#f59e0b">
    Thinking capability with good speed
  </Card>
  <Card title="Max Mode" color="#8b5cf6">
    Highest capability for complex tasks
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Mode Comparison

| Feature | Fast | Flash | Max |
|---------|------|-------|-----|
| **Primary Focus** | Cost optimization | Thinking + speed balance | Maximum capability |
| **Model Mixture** | Efficiency-focused models | Thinking + speed models | Advanced + specialized models |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Highest | Moderate | Lower |
| **Thinking Capability** | Basic | Enhanced | Advanced |
| **Use Cases** | Most general tasks | Complex tasks with thinking | Research, analysis |
| **Best For** | Simple to moderate tasks | Tasks requiring reasoning | Complex multi-step work |
| **Response Time** | Fastest | Fast | Moderate |

## How Modes Optimize Costs

1. **Fewer Steps = Lower Costs**
   - Smart planning reduces redundant operations
   - Efficient context management across steps

2. **Model Selection Intelligence**
   - Route simple tasks to faster, cheaper models
   - Use powerful models only when necessary

3. **Custom Model Integration**
   - Purpose-built models for specific agent workflows
   - Optimized for tool usage and planning

## Choosing the Right Mode

### Fast Mode
Most cost-effective option. Perfect for straightforward tasks and general automation.

```json
{
  "message": "Send a summary email of today's sales",
  "mode": "fast"
}
```

### Flash Mode  
Well-balanced mode with thinking capabilities. Use when tasks require reasoning but still need good speed.

```json
{
  "message": "Analyze this data and suggest three optimization strategies",
  "mode": "flash"
}
```

### Max Mode
Best for complex analysis, research tasks, and scenarios requiring maximum capability.

```json
{
  "message": "Research market trends and create a comprehensive competitive analysis",
  "mode": "max"
}
```

## Implementation Examples

### API Usage

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh/v1/run-agent" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Your task here",
    "mode": "fast"
  }'
```

### SDK Usage

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
response = client.run_agent(
    message="Analyze this dataset",
    mode="fast"  # or "flash", "max"
)
```

```javascript TypeScript
const response = await agentbase.runAgent({
  message: "Analyze this dataset",
  mode: "fast" // or "flash", "max"
});
```
</CodeGroup>

## Performance Recommendations

1. **Start with Fast Mode** for most tasks - it's the most cost-effective
2. **Use Flash Mode** when tasks involve lots of thinking and tool usage
3. **Use Max Mode** for complex analysis and research requiring maximum capability
4. **Monitor costs** and adjust modes based on task complexity
