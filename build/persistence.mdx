> Agentbase uses a two-tier persistence model that separates conversational state from computational environments for optimal performance and cost efficiency.

## Two-Tier Persistence Model

### 1. Chat & Message History

**Automatic & Free**: Message history persists by default at no cost.

- Zero cost for storage
- Automatic for all conversations
- Use session IDs to maintain context

### 2. Computer Environment

**On-Demand Creation**: Computers are created when agents need them for code execution, file operations, or web browsing.

- Auto-pause after 5 minutes of inactivity
- Files and installations remain
- Use same session ID to reuse environment

<Tip>
  **Remember**: Chat history persists automatically and free, while computer environments are created only when needed and then persist for ongoing use.
