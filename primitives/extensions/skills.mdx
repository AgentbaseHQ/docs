> Skills enable agents to learn and master new capabilities, from specialized domain knowledge to complex procedural tasks, making them more capable and autonomous over time.

## Overview

The Skills primitive allows you to teach agents new capabilities that they can apply across different contexts. Unlike tools which are function calls, skills represent learned behaviors, procedures, and domain knowledge that agents internalize and adapt to various situations.

Skills are essential for:

- **Specialization**: Train agents in specific domains or disciplines
- **Procedure Learning**: Teach multi-step processes and best practices
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Share expertise across agent instances
- **Capability Extension**: Add new abilities without code changes
- **Continuous Improvement**: Agents learn from experience and feedback
- **Consistency**: Ensure standard approaches across tasks

## How Skills Work

When you teach an agent a skill:

1. **Definition**: Skill defined with description, examples, and context
2. **Training**: Agent learns skill through examples and practice
3. **Application**: Agent applies skill when relevant to tasks
4. **Feedback**: Performance feedback refines skill execution
5. **Improvement**: Skill proficiency increases with usage
6. **Transfer**: Successful skills can be shared with other agents

<Note>
**Skill Persistence**: Skills are saved and persist across agent sessions, building a knowledge base over time.

## Integration with Other Primitives

### With Memory

Remember skill application contexts:

```typescript
const result = await agentbase.runAgent({
  message: "Help with customer support",
  skills: ["customer_support"],
  memory: {
    namespace: `agent_skills`,
    enabled: true
  }
});

// Agent remembers successful approaches for different situations
```

Learn more: [Memory Primitive](/primitives/extensions/memory)

### With Multi-Agent

Distribute specialized skills:

```typescript
const result = await agentbase.runAgent({
  message: "Review this business proposal",
  agents: [
    {
      name: "Legal Specialist",
      skills: ["contract_review", "legal_compliance"]
    },
    {
      name: "Financial Analyst",
      skills: ["financial_analysis", "risk_assessment"]
    },
    {
      name: "Technical Reviewer",
      skills: ["technical_feasibility", "system_design"]
    }
  ]
});

// Each agent applies their specialized skills
```

Learn more: [Multi-Agent Primitive](/primitives/essentials/multi-agents)

### With Tasks

Apply skills to task execution:

```typescript
await agentbase.createTask({
  title: "Perform security audit",
  assignee: "security_agent",
  requiredSkills: ["security_audit", "penetration_testing"],
  skillProficiency: "advanced"
});

// Only agents with required skills can execute task
```

## Performance Considerations

### Skill Loading

- **On-Demand**: Skills loaded only when needed
- **Caching**: Frequently used skills cached in memory
- **Lazy Loading**: Complex skills loaded progressively

### Skill Complexity

- **Simple Skills**: < 100ms overhead
- **Complex Skills**: < 500ms overhead
- **Optimization**: Pre-compile common skill patterns

### Scaling

```typescript
// Optimize skill performance
{
  skillId: "data_analysis",
  optimization: {
    cacheExamples: true,
    preloadContext: true,
    parallelProcessing: true
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Skill Not Applied Correctly">
    **Problem**: Agent doesn't use skill as expected

    **Solutions**:
    - Verify skill is explicitly enabled for agent
    - Check skill proficiency level is sufficient
    - Review skill instructions for clarity
    - Provide more examples for edge cases
    - Check if conflicting skills are active

    ```typescript
    // Debug skill application
    const debug = await agentbase.runAgent({
      message: "Test task",
      skills: ["target_skill"],
      debug: {
        skillApplication: true
      }
    });

    console.log('Skills considered:', debug.skillsConsidered);
    console.log('Skill selected:', debug.skillSelected);
    console.log('Application reasoning:', debug.reasoning);
    ```

  <Accordion title="Low Skill Proficiency">
    **Problem**: Skill performance is inconsistent

    **Solutions**:
    - Provide more training examples
    - Enable feedback-based learning
    - Simplify skill instructions
    - Break complex skill into sub-skills
    - Increase practice iterations

    ```typescript
    // Boost skill proficiency
    await agentbase.trainSkill({
      skillId: "negotiation",
      intensiveTraining: true,
      practiceRounds: 50,
      feedbackLoop: true
    });
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Skill Conflicts">
    **Problem**: Multiple skills interfere with each other

    **Solutions**:
    - Define skill priority order
    - Create skill compatibility rules
    - Use skill contexts to isolate application
    - Combine related skills into single comprehensive skill

    ```typescript
    // Manage skill priorities
    {
      agentId: "agent_123",
      skillPriorities: [
        { skillId: "security_first", priority: 1 },
        { skillId: "performance_optimization", priority: 2 },
        { skillId: "code_elegance", priority: 3 }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Advanced Patterns

### Skill Composition

Combine multiple skills:

```typescript
const compositeSkill = await agentbase.createSkill({
  name: "full_stack_development",
  type: "composite",
  subSkills: [
    "frontend_development",
    "backend_development",
    "database_design",
    "devops",
    "testing"
  ],
  integration: "Coordinate all aspects of application development"
});
```

### Context-Aware Skills

Adapt skill to context:

```typescript
{
  skillId: "communication",
  contextRules: [
    {
      context: { audience: "executives" },
      adjustments: { style: "formal", detail: "high-level" }
    },
    {
      context: { audience: "developers" },
      adjustments: { style: "technical", detail: "implementation-focused" }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Skill Inheritance

Create skill hierarchies:

```typescript
// Base skill
const baseSkill = await agentbase.createSkill({
  name: "programming_fundamentals",
  instructions: "Core programming concepts..."
});

// Specialized skill inherits from base
const specializeda = await agentbase.createSkill({
  name: "python_programming",
  inheritsFrom: "programming_fundamentals",
  additionalInstructions: "Python-specific patterns and idioms..."
});
```
