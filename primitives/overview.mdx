## What Are Agent Primitives?

Agent primitives are the fundamental building blocks that make up Agentbase agents. Understanding these primitives helps you build more sophisticated and capable agents.

## How Primitives Work Together

Primitives combine to create powerful agent capabilities:

    A[User Request] --> B[Prompts]
    B --> C[Agent Reasoning]
    C --> D[Custom Tools]
    D --> E[Environment]
    E --> F[Sandbox]
    E --> G[File System]
    E --> H[Browser]
    C --> I[Extensions]
    I --> J[Web Search]

```

### Example: Research Agent

A research agent might use these primitives:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Input via Prompts">
    User provides research query through natural language prompt
  </Step>

  <Step title="Web Search Extension">
    Agent uses web search to find relevant sources
  </Step>

  <Step title="Browser Environment">
    Navigates to websites and extracts content
  </Step>

  <Step title="RAG Extension">
    Stores and retrieves information from documents
  </Step>

  <Step title="File System">
    Saves research findings and generates report
  </Step>

  <Step title="Session Persistence">
    Maintains context across multiple queries
  </Step>

  <Step title="Traces">
    Logs all steps for debugging and optimization
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Choosing the Right Primitives

  </Card>

  <Card title="Add as Needed" icon="plus">
    Incorporate extensions when requirements grow
  </Card>

  <Card title="Consider Performance" icon="gauge">
    More primitives = more complexity (balance capability vs. efficiency)

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Simple Task Execution

**Primitives:** Prompts + Sandbox + Traces

```typescript
// Simple code execution
const result = await agentbase.runAgent({
  message: "Create a Python function to calculate fibonacci",
  mode: "base"
});
```

### Pattern 2: Stateful Conversation

**Primitives:** Prompts + Sessions + Context Management

```typescript
// Multi-turn conversation
const result1 = await agentbase.runAgent({
  message: "Analyze data.csv"
});

const result2 = await agentbase.runAgent({
  message: "Now create a visualization",
  session: result1.session
});
```

### Pattern 3: Research & Analysis

**Primitives:** Web Search + Browser + RAG + File System

```typescript
// Research task
const result = await agentbase.runAgent({
  message: "Research our top 3 competitors and create a comparison report",
  mode: "max"
});
```

### Pattern 4: Automated Workflow

**Primitives:** Scheduling + Tasks + Hooks + Email

```typescript
// Scheduled automation
const result = await agentbase.runAgent({
  message: "Check competitor pricing daily and email me if prices change",
  mode: "base"
});
```

### Pattern 5: Multi-Agent System

**Primitives:** Multi-Agents + Orchestration + Parallelization

```typescript
// Coordinated agents
const result = await agentbase.runAgent({
  message: "Use one agent to gather data and another to analyze it",
  mode: "max"
});
```
