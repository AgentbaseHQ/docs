## üöÄ Getting Started with Your Use Case

<Note>
  **Start Simple**: Pick one use case that addresses your biggest pain point. Test it with the CLI first, then integrate into your existing systems.
</Note>

**Integration patterns that work:**

1. **Webhook Integration**: Trigger agents from existing systems (CRM, support tickets, etc.)
2. **API Middleware**: Add agent processing to existing API endpoints
3. **Scheduled Tasks**: Run agents on cron jobs for regular analysis and reports
4. **User-Triggered**: Allow users to invoke agents for specific tasks
5. **Background Processing**: Queue agent tasks for non-blocking operations

**Next steps:**
- Choose a use case that fits your team's immediate needs
- Start with the [Quickstart](/getting-started/quickstart) to understand agent basics
- Review the [API documentation](/api/run-agent) for integration details
- Join our [Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/KFtqf7j9fs) to share your implementation

<Tip>
  **Pro tip**: The same agent can handle multiple related tasks. For example, a customer service agent can answer questions, escalate issues, AND analyze conversation sentiment - all in one integration.
