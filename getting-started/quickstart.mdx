Get your first AI agent running locally in 2 minutes.

**Start in the app:** Visit the [overview page](https://base.agentbase.sh/overview) for a guided quickstart that walks you through:

1. **Choose your SDK** - TypeScript, Python, or cURL
2. **Get your API key** - Secure authentication setup
3. **Copy the bootstrap command** - One-click setup
4. **Select your agent mode** - Flash, Base, or Max
5. **Configure add-ons** - Optional integrations

The guided setup generates a ready-to-use code snippet you can paste directly into your IDE.

## Before you begin

- [Agentbase account](https://base.agentbase.sh/sign-up) with credits
- Node.js 18+ installed

<Tip>Sign up with your work email to get free credits automatically!</Tip>

## Step 1: Install and run

```bash
# Create your agent project
npm create agentbase@latest

# Select to create a Next.js agent chat app or a terminal chat app
📦 Select a template:
  1. agent-chat-nextjs (Next.js app)
  2. terminal-chat (Terminal agent chat)
✔ Choose template (1 or 2) (1):

# Navigate and start
cd my-agent
npm run dev
```

You'll be prompted to add your API key on first use. You can get your API key from the [overview page](https://base.agentbase.sh/overview).

## Step 2: Test capabilities

Try these prompts in the CLI to understand what agents can do:

```
> What can you do?
> Write and run a Python function to calculate fibonacci numbers
> Search for the latest AI news and summarize it
> Create a React component for a user profile card
```

## Step 3: Understand agent modes

Change the mode in your `index.ts` file:

```typescript
const params = {
  message: message,
  mode: "base", // "base", "flash", or "max"
};
```

**Mode differences:**

- **Flash**: Shows agent thinking process and steps
- **Base**: Balanced performance (recommended)
- **Max**: Advanced reasoning for complex tasks

You can also test your agents in the [Agentbase playground](https://base.agentbase.sh/playground).
