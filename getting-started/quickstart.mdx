> Welcome to Agentbase!

This quickstart guide will have you using AI-powered agents in just a few minutes. We built a general-purpose agent called "Base" that doesn't use any framework - it's a raw agent for simplicity. It's delivered via API and comes with all features in one request. The API is packed with features for you to add capabilities, skills, and more to your software build or project.

You'll start by exploring the capabilities through our CLI, then learn how to integrate Agentbase to power intelligent features in your applications.

## Before you begin

Make sure you have:
* A terminal or command prompt open
* An [Agentbase account](https://base.agentbase.sh/sign-up) with credits  
* Node.js 18 or newer installed

<Tip>

## Step 1: Install Agentbase CLI

Install the CLI to explore Agentbase capabilities:

```bash
# Create your first agent project
npm create agentbase@latest

# Navigate to your project
cd my-agent

# Start the interactive CLI
npm run dev
# You'll be prompted to add your API key on first use
```

## Step 2: Test CLI chat to understand Agentbase

When you run `npm run dev`, you'll see the Agentbase prompt:

```
✻ Welcome to Agentbase!

> Try asking "What can you do?" to get started...
```

Test basic interactions to understand agent capabilities:

```
> What can you do?
> Can you write and run code?
> Can you search the web for current information?
> Can you use a browser to visit websites?
```

<Note>
  The CLI uses the same API as your applications will use, so testing here directly translates to production integration.
</Note>

## Step 3: Try different agent modes

Test the different agent modes to understand their capabilities. You can experiment in two ways:

**Editing the code directly:**
In your project's `index.ts` file, find the `sendMessage` function and add a `mode` parameter:

```typescript
/**
 * Send a message to the agent and process the response stream
 */
async function sendMessage(message: string) {
  try {
    // Prepare parameters - include session ID if we have one
    const params: {
      message: string; // The message to send to the agent
      session?: string; // The session ID to continue the conversation
      mode?: string | "flash" | "fast" | "max"; // The mode for the agent, defaults to fast
      system?: string; // The system prompt for the agent
      rules?: string[]; // The rules for the agent
      mcpServers?: [{ serverName: string; serverUrl: string }]; // The MCP servers for the agent
      streaming?: boolean; // Whether to stream the response token by token, defaults to false
    } = { 
      message: message,
      mode: "fast" // Change to "fast", "flash", or "max"
    };

    // Include session ID if we have one to maintain the agent conversation
    if (sessionId) {
      params.session = sessionId;
    }

    // Send message and get response stream
    const stream = await agentbase.runAgent(params);

    // Process each response in the stream
    for await (const response of stream) {
      handleResponse(response);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("❌ Error:", error);
  }
}
```

**Using curl commands:**
```bash
# Edit the "mode" field to "fast", "flash", or "max"
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Your task here", "mode": "fast"}'
```

**Mode differences:**
- **Fast**: Balanced performance, best for most production use cases (no thinking events)
- **Flash**: Shows agent thinking process, good for learning and debugging  
- **Max**: Advanced reasoning for complex multi-step tasks (includes thinking events)

<Note>
  Agent thinking events (showing reasoning process) are available in **flash** and **max** modes, but not in fast mode.
</Note>

## Step 4: Maintain session for conversations

To keep the agent in the same conversation context, you need to maintain the session ID:

**Editing the code directly:**
In your project's `index.ts` file, the session ID is already handled in the `sendMessage` function:

```typescript
/**
 * Send a message to the agent and process the response stream
 */
async function sendMessage(message: string) {
  try {
    // Prepare parameters - include session ID if we have one
    const params: {
      message: string; // The message to send to the agent
      session?: string; // The session ID to continue the conversation
      mode?: string | "flash" | "fast" | "max"; // The mode for the agent, defaults to fast
      system?: string; // The system prompt for the agent
      rules?: string[]; // The rules for the agent
      mcpServers?: [{ serverName: string; serverUrl: string }]; // The MCP servers for the agent
      streaming?: boolean; // Whether to stream the response token by token, defaults to false
    } = { 
      message: message
    };

    // Include session ID if we have one to maintain the agent conversation
    if (sessionId) {
      params.session = sessionId;
    }

    // Send message and get response stream
    const stream = await agentbase.runAgent(params);

    // Process each response in the stream
    for await (const response of stream) {
      handleResponse(response);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("❌ Error:", error);
  }
}
```

**Using curl commands:**
```bash
# First message creates a new session
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Help me plan a marketing campaign"}'

# Continue with the session ID from the response
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh?session=SESSION_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Now create social media content for this campaign"}'
```

<Note>
  Without maintaining the session ID, each request starts a new conversation and the agent won't remember previous context.
</Note>

## Step 5: Test streaming vs complete messages

Experiment with different response formats. You can test in two ways:

**Editing the code directly:**
In your project's `index.ts` file, find the `sendMessage` function and add a `streaming` parameter:

```typescript
/**
 * Send a message to the agent and process the response stream
 */
async function sendMessage(message: string) {
  try {
    // Prepare parameters - include session ID if we have one
    const params: {
      message: string; // The message to send to the agent
      session?: string; // The session ID to continue the conversation
      mode?: string | "flash" | "fast" | "max"; // The mode for the agent, defaults to fast
      system?: string; // The system prompt for the agent
      rules?: string[]; // The rules for the agent
      mcpServers?: [{ serverName: string; serverUrl: string }]; // The MCP servers for the agent
      streaming?: boolean; // Whether to stream the response token by token, defaults to false
    } = { 
      message: message,
      streaming: false // Change to true for token-by-token, false for complete responses
    };

    // Include session ID if we have one to maintain the agent conversation
    if (sessionId) {
      params.session = sessionId;
    }

    // Send message and get response stream
    const stream = await agentbase.runAgent(params);

    // Process each response in the stream
    for await (const response of stream) {
      handleResponse(response);
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("❌ Error:", error);
  }
}
```

**Using curl commands:**
```bash
# Edit the "streaming" field to true or false
curl -X POST "https://api.agentbase.sh" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Your task here", "streaming": false}'
```

**When to use each:**
- **Streaming (true)**: Better user experience for long responses, real-time feedback
- **Complete (false)**: Easier to handle programmatically, better for automated processing

**Streaming event types:**
When streaming is enabled, you'll receive different event types with specific labels.

<Note>
  See the complete list of [Streaming Message Types](/api/streaming-message-types) for all event details and examples.
</Note>

## Step 6: Test computer and agentic capabilities

Now let's explore the agent's ability to use a computer and perform complex agentic tasks:

**Computer capabilities:**
```
> Can you write a Python script that calculates the Fibonacci sequence and run it?
```

**Research and analysis:**
```
> Research renewable energy trends and create a market analysis report
```

**Content creation:**
```
> Create a social media campaign for a coffee shop including posts, images, and scheduling
```

<Note>
  The agent can automatically use computer instances, web search, and browser automation. You don't need to specify which tools to use - just describe what you want to achieve. See [Common Use Cases](/intro/common-use-cases) for more examples.
</Note>

## Ready to integrate?

You now understand the core Agentbase concepts! The CLI uses the same API your applications will use, so everything you've tested here translates directly to production.

**Two ways to use Agentbase:**

1. **Embed into existing applications** - Add agent capabilities to your current software with simple API calls to make it agent-native
2. **Start fresh with agents** - Create a new Agentbase project and build agent-powered applications from the ground up

**Key parameters for integration:**

| Parameter | What it does | Example |
| --------- | ------------ | ------- |
| `message` | The task for your agent | `"Write a Python function"` |
| `mode` | Agent capability level | `"flash"`, `"fast"`, `"max"` |
| `streaming` | Response format | `true` (token-by-token), `false` (complete) |
| `session` | Continue conversation | `?session=SESSION_ID` |
| `system` | Give agent expertise | `"You are a data scientist"` |
| `rules` | Set constraints | `["Be concise", "Show examples"]` |

See the [API reference](/api/run-agent) for complete integration examples and parameter details.
