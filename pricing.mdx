> Pay per action, not per token. Simple pricing that scales with value delivered.

## Cost-per-Step Pricing

*All prices in US dollars*

| Mode | Cost per Step | Cached Step | Best For |
|------|---------------|-------------|----------|
| **Fast** | $0.01 - $0.04 | $0.003 - $0.012 | _Simple tasks, high-volume operations_ |
| **Flash** | $0.05 - $0.15 | $0.015 - $0.045 | _**Recommended** - Balanced workflows_ |
| **Max** | $0.15 - $0.40 | $0.045 - $0.12 | _Advanced reasoning and analysis_ |

<Note>
**Variable Pricing**: Not every task requires a computer or large context. Prices vary based on _context size_ and whether your agent needs _computer capabilities_ - simple text-based tasks stay at the lower end of each range.
</Note>

## Why Step-Based Pricing?

Instead of confusing token-based billing, Agentbase charges per **step** - each _discrete action_ your agent takes.

**What counts as a step:**
- Planning and reasoning
- Tool usage (web search, file operations, etc.)
- Analysis and decision making
- Response generation

**Total Cost of Ownership Benefits:**
- **Fewer total steps** - Our optimized agents complete tasks _more efficiently_
- **Predictable costs** - No surprise bills from _token overruns_  
- **Value-aligned pricing** - Pay for _results_, not just compute time
- **No token counting** - Focus on _building_, not optimization

### Get Started
- **Free credits** with _work email_ signup
- **Start small**: Fast mode for _experimentation and simple tasks_
- **Scale up**: Flash mode for _most production workflows_
- **Testing budget**: $15-$30 recommended for _extensive testing_

## Context Window Tiers

Our pricing reflects the computational cost of processing different context sizes:

| Small Context (< 30k tokens) | Large Context (30k - 128k tokens) |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| _Most cost-effective_ for standard workflows | _Higher pricing_ reflects increased computational requirements |
| Handles _typical conversations, documents, and code files_ | Supports _large documents, extensive conversations, complex codebases_ |
| **Best for**: _API calls, data analysis, simple automation_ | **Best for**: _Document analysis, long conversations, comprehensive research_ |

## Prompt Caching

<Tip>
**70% savings** on cached rates when context is _reused across steps_. Perfect for _conversational agents_ and _recurring workflows_ where the same context is processed multiple times.
</Tip>

## How We Optimize Your Costs

### Intelligent Model Routing
Agentbase uses a **mixture of models** optimized for different task types, automatically routing to the _most cost-effective option_:

**Step Reduction Strategy:**
- **Smart planning** reduces _redundant operations_
- **Efficient context management** across _multi-step workflows_
- **Optimized tool usage** minimizes _unnecessary steps_

**Value Alignment:**
- We make money when we solve your problems _efficiently_
- Our incentive is to _reduce total steps_, which saves you money
- Focus on **Total Cost of Ownership**, not _per-API-call_ pricing

## Cost Tracking & Features

### Real-Time Cost Monitoring
```javascript
// Included in every API response
{
  "type": "agent_cost",
  "session": "e3jbak7k4xnvct3",
  "cost": "0.0146",
  "balance": 47.4557,
  "deductionSuccess": true,
  "lowBalance": false
}
```

### How Costs Scale by Task Type

| Task Type | Computer Needed? | Cost Level | Examples |
|-----------|------------------|------------|----------|
| **Text & Analysis** | No | Lower | _Writing, research, planning_ |
| **Code & Files** | Yes | Medium | _Programming, file operations_ |
| **Multi-tool Workflows** | Yes | Higher | _Web scraping + analysis + reports_ |

<Note>
  Costs increase when agents use computer environments and multiple tools. Simple text-based tasks keep costs minimal.
