Traces provide detailed execution logs of your agent's behavior, helping you debug issues, optimize performance, and understand how your agent processes requests.

## What are Traces?

Traces are comprehensive execution logs that capture every step of your agent's workflow, including:

- **Agent Initialization**: When the agent starts processing a request
- **Agent Steps**: Each reasoning step the agent takes
- **Tool Usage**: When and how the agent uses tools
- **Tool Responses**: Results returned from tool executions
- **Agent Responses**: Final responses generated by the agent

Each event in the trace includes:
- Timestamp of when it occurred
- Duration of execution
- Detailed information about inputs and outputs
- Status (completed, in progress, failed)

## Accessing Traces

Navigate to the **Traces** page in your Agentbase dashboard under the **Improve** section. Here you'll find:

1. **Sessions**: A list of all agent execution sessions with unique session IDs
2. **Traces**: Individual agent runs within each session
3. **Timeline**: A chronological view of all events in a trace

## Using Traces for Debugging

Traces are invaluable for:

- **Performance Optimization**: Identify slow steps or tool calls by examining execution durations
- **Error Diagnosis**: Pinpoint where failures occur in your agent's workflow
- **Behavior Analysis**: Understand the reasoning path your agent takes
- **Tool Usage Monitoring**: See which tools are being called and how often
- **Response Quality**: Review agent responses and the context that led to them

## Trace Events

### Agent Initialization
Records when the agent begins processing a request, including the initial prompt and configuration.

### Agent Steps
Each step represents a discrete reasoning action by the agent. Steps are numbered sequentially (Step 0, Step 1, etc.) and show:
- The agent's thought process
- Decisions about which tools to use
- Planning for next actions

### Tool Events
Tool usage is captured in two events:
- **Tool: [name]** - When a tool is invoked, showing the tool name and parameters
- **Tool Response: [name]** - The result returned by the tool execution

### Agent Response
The final response generated by the agent after completing all necessary steps.

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Use traces during development to validate that your agent is using tools correctly and following expected reasoning patterns.
</Tip>

- **Regular Monitoring**: Review traces periodically to catch issues early
- **Performance Tracking**: Compare execution times across different agent modes
- **Error Patterns**: Look for recurring failures to identify systemic issues
- **Tool Optimization**: Analyze tool usage patterns to optimize your tool implementations

<Note>
Traces are automatically captured for all agent runs. You can search and filter traces by session ID, time range, or status to find specific executions.
