To authenticate API requests you need a secret key starting with `sk-ptr-`.

1. Sign in to your [Agentbase dashboard](https://agentbase.sh).
2. Navigate to **API Keys â†’ Generate new key**.
3. Store the key securely (environment variables recommended).

Use it in every request header:
```http
Authorization: Bearer sk-ptr-XXXXX
```
