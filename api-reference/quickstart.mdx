### Option 1: Agent API (For Developers)
Integrate Pointer's agent directly into your applications.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Get Your API Key" icon="key">
    Navigate to your [API keys page](https://trypointer.com) on the Pointer dashboard, sign in, and generate a new key. Your key will start with `sk-ptr-`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Make Your First API Call" icon="code-branch">
    Use this cURL command in your terminal to send your first message to the agent.
    ```bash
    curl -X POST "https://pointerapi.com" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
      -d '{"message": "What can you do?"}'
    ```
    You'll receive a real-time stream of the agent's response.
