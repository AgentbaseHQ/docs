What is Agentbase? 

Agentbase is an **agent cloud** platform for building, testing, and deploying AI agents. If you're building agents that need to use multiple tools, control browsers, and perform complex automations, Agentbase manages the underlying agent and dependency infrastructure so you don't have to.

We bundle all the critical dependencies for running production-grade agents into a complete, out-of-the-box solution. This means **no agent frameworks are required**. 

Agentbase provides a simple API for deploying stateful, persistent agents, features for managing custom tools, and a scalable, reliable infrastructure to run them in production.
